# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this application locally, you need to have the following tools installed on your machine:

### Required Toolset

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or newer)  
  Download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

- **Yarn** (a package manager for JavaScript)  
  Install it globally using npm (comes with Node.js):  
  ```bash
  npm install -g yarn
  ```

- **Git** (optional, for version control)  
  Download and install it from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/).

## Running the Application Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository

If you haven't cloned the project yet, use the following command to clone it from the GitHub repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory

Move into the project's folder:
```bash
cd your-repository-name
```

### 3. Install dependencies

To install all the required packages, run the following command:
```bash
yarn install
```

### 4. Start the development server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the app in development mode:
```bash
yarn start
```

This will launch the app and automatically open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your default browser. The app will reload if you make any changes to the source code, and you'll see errors or warnings in the browser console or terminal.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
